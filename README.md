### About me
Hi, i'm Robinson, but you can also call me Robin, for short. I like to take life lightly and humorous, so we are probably going to get along fine and crack a good laugh together.
  Currently working on my degree in information systems at [UFES](https://www.ufes.br). I was first introduced to programming while trying to learn how to gamedev, where i got the basics of C. Since then, i learned **python**, **js**, **java**, **react native** and **nodeJS**. My latest project is a mobile app called [Hommy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.ufes.hommy&hl=pt&gl=US), which its main objective is to create a platform for people who wants to share their rent. Nowadays, Im a developer analyst at [Itix](https://www.itixti.com.br), where i'm working mostly with **C#** and **JS**. I've also worked with **Java**, **Angular** and some auto testing with **Cypress**.
